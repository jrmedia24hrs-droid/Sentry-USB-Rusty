## What it does

- **Plugs into your Tesla's USB port** and pretends to be a dashcam drive.
- **Tracks every drive** — route on a map, distance, speed, and the dashcam clips that recorded it — built from the metadata Tesla embeds in each clip.
- **Enriches drives with Tesla BLE telemetry** — battery, HVAC, cabin and exterior temps, TPMS, odometer, and location — pulled over Bluetooth and layered onto each trip for a much fuller picture than the dashcam metadata gives you on its own.
- **Archives clips automatically** to your NAS, cloud, or wherever — over WiFi, in the background.
- **Keeps the car awake** (and the dashcam recording) via the same BLE link — no Tesla API subscription needed.
- **Privacy-first.** No fingerprinting by default; everything sensitive is opt-in.

The Rust rewrite of the original Go version. Same `sentryusb.conf`, faster server, more reliable.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Drives tracking** | Every trip with route, distance, duration, battery deltas, and FSD usage — plus the dashcam clips one click in |
| **Tesla BLE telemetry** | Adds battery, HVAC, cabin/exterior temps, TPMS, odometer, and location to each drive — beyond what Tesla's dashcam metadata carries on its own |
| **Multi-camera viewer** | Synchronized 6-camera playback with HW3-aware adaptive grid and drift correction |
| **Auto-archive** | CIFS / SMB, rsync, rclone (cloud), NFS — kicks off whenever the Pi sees known WiFi |
| **Keep awake** | BLE (free, same link as telemetry), TeslaFi, Tessie, or generic webhook |
| **Sentry Cloud (beta)** | Encrypted cloud sync — drives are encrypted on the Pi before they leave your network |
| **Notifications** | Pushover, ntfy, Gotify, Discord, Telegram, Slack, Signal, Matrix, AWS SNS, IFTTT, Webhook, iOS app |
| **Privacy-first** | No device fingerprint by default. Opt-in analytics, full per-flow disclosure |

## Install

> **No prebuilt SD card image yet.** You start from stock Raspberry Pi OS Lite and run a one-liner over SSH. A prebuilt image is on the roadmap — for now this is the only supported install path. See the [full Getting Started guide](https://github.com/Sentry-Six/Sentry-USB-Rusty/wiki/Getting-Started) for the click-by-click walkthrough.

On a Pi already running **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo -i
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sentry-Six/Sentry-USB-Rusty/main/install-pi.sh | bash
```

> The `apt update && apt upgrade` step is required. Pi OS images bake in an apt cache from whenever the image was built; if Debian has shipped a point release since then, the cache points at `.deb` versions that no longer exist on the mirrors and the install will hit `404 Not Found` errors. Refreshing first avoids the round trip.

Then open `http://sentryusb.local` in a browser and the setup wizard takes you the rest of the way.

### Hardware

| Tier | Boards | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Recommended** | Raspberry Pi 4B, Raspberry Pi 5 | USB 2.0 OTG — fastest archiving, smoothest UI |
| **Tested** | Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Raspberry Pi 3 (A+/B/B+) | USB 2.0 OTG — works fine, slower archive speeds |
| **Community** | Radxa Rock Pi 4C+, Radxa Zero 3W | USB 3.0 OTG — reported working, not officially supported |

Plus a **256 GB+ MicroSD card** and a **USB 3.0 data cable** (not charge-only) between the Pi and your Tesla. Use a 3.0 cable even on USB 2.0 boards — it delivers more power and keeps lower-end Pis stable.

## Privacy

By default, Sentry USB sends **no device identifier** to our servers. Here's everything it ever sends:

| When | What | Identifier? |
|---|---|---|
| Daily update check | Software version, CPU arch, board model | None by default |
| Once per install | Empty ping (no body) | None — anonymous counter |
| Wraps / lock chime submissions | The file + your IP for rate-limiting | None |
| Sentry Cloud (if signed in) | Your account + synced files | Account credentials |
| iOS push pairing (if enabled) | Random pairing ID | Not tied to hardware |

The only way a device fingerprint is sent is if you explicitly opt in to **Settings → Privacy → Analytics opt-in** (default: off). Full disclosure including legal basis, retention, and how to disable each flow lives in [`wiki/Privacy.md`](wiki/Privacy.md).

## Build from source

Prerequisites: Rust stable, Node 20+, and `cross` (`cargo install cross`).

```bash
# Web UI
cd web && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..
rm -rf crates/sentryusb/static && cp -r web/dist crates/sentryusb/static

# Binaries (aarch64)
cross build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu -p sentryusb

# 32-bit (armhf — Pi 3 with 32-bit Pi OS):
cross build --release --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf -p sentryusb
```

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for details.

### Build a full Pi image (advanced)

```bash
./build-image.sh                 # 64-bit image (Pi 3/4/5/Zero 2)
./build-image.sh --32bit         # 32-bit image (armhf — Pi 3 with 32-bit Pi OS)
```

The build-image script is for developers and CI; end users should use the curl-one-liner install above.
