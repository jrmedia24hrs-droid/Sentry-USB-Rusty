//! Push 4: persistent BLE session manager.
//!
//! The current per-call pattern (scan → connect → handshake → command
//! → disconnect) opens a fresh GATT connection for every query. That
//! works but means we never hold a Tesla BLE connection slot —
//! every cycle we re-compete for one of the car's ~3 slots against
//! phone keys + the iOS app. Connection failures during a busy
//! moment ("paired phone walked up while we were sampling") look
//! to the sampler like generic BLE flakiness.
//!
//! `PersistentSession` flips that: one long-lived background tokio
//! task owns the `Connection` + per-domain session keys across many
//! commands. Once we have the slot, we keep it until the link
//! genuinely dies. Phone keys can connect and disconnect freely
//! against the remaining slots without disrupting us, and our
//! per-query overhead drops from ~1.5-2s (scan + handshake + cmd)
//! to ~200-500ms (just the cmd).
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let session = PersistentSession::start(keypair, vin).await;
//! loop {
//!     let climate = session.query(
//!         Domain::Infotainment,
//!         VehicleDataState::Climate,
//!     ).await?;
//!     // ... parse, persist
//!     tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(15)).await;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Recovery behavior
//!
//! * Transport error (BLE link drop / GATT timeout) → drop connection,
//!   next query triggers a fresh scan + reconnect. Reconnect backs
//!   off on repeated failures but each new `query()` call resets the
//!   schedule so a long idle followed by a sudden burst connects
//!   immediately.
//! * Counter/epoch fault from car (the car has seen this counter
//!   before, or the epoch rolled over) → drop the affected domain's
//!   session state, next query re-handshakes just that domain. The
//!   underlying GATT connection stays up.
//! * Other faults → returned to caller, no state changes.
