//! Persistent BLE session manager.
//!
//! The per-call pattern (scan → connect → handshake → command →
//! disconnect) opens a fresh GATT connection per query, so it never
//! holds one of the car's ~3 BLE slots and re-competes against the
//! phone keys and iOS app every cycle. `PersistentSession` keeps one
//! long-lived connection plus per-domain session keys across many
//! commands, cutting per-query cost from ~1.5-2s to ~200-500ms.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let session = PersistentSession::start(keypair, vin, adapter);
//! loop {
//!     let climate = session
//!         .query(Domain::Infotainment, VehicleDataState::Climate)
//!         .await?;
//!     tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(15)).await;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Recovery
//!
//! * Transport error (link drop / GATT timeout) → drop the connection;
//!   the next query rescans and reconnects, backing off on repeats.
//! * Counter/epoch fault → drop that domain's session state; the next
//!   query re-handshakes just that domain, connection stays up.
//! * Other faults → returned to the caller.
