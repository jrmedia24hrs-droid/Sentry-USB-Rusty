/// of the ~150+ a tight timeout allows. The shorter we fail, the
/// more chances we have to win the slot in the brief window the
/// phone is silent (advertising, switching channels, etc.).

        // initiate write" because the data can't fit in a single

        // Tesla's actual response — try_unframe read its first 2
        // bytes as a length (always > 1024 since the bytes were

        // spinning if the link is genuinely flooded with garbage; at
        // that point the wall-clock timeout should fire anyway, but

        //     was seeing 5956 recoveries/49min with 0 successful
        //     queries. Turned out the ROOT cause was our TX side
        //     using ATT_Write_Cmd (fixed in 4784302 by switching
        //     to ATT_Write_Req); the desync storms were downstream
