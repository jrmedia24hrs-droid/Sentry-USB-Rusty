//! Set the Pi's system clock from the vehicle's GPS-derived timestamp.
//!
//! Why: Tesla's car has an always-accurate clock (GPS-synced). Every
//! `state X` response includes a `timestamp` field in the car's clock
//! frame. If our local Pi clock is significantly off — typical when
//! there's no RTC battery and WiFi isn't reachable at boot — we can
//! correct it from the first successful BLE response, with no
//! dependency on NTP or internet access.
//!
//! Design:
//!   * Latency-compensated: applies half the round-trip-time to the
//!     vehicle timestamp, so we land within ~50 ms of the true time
//!     even though the BLE call took 1-5 s.
//!   * NTP-friendly: only adjusts when local-vs-vehicle delta exceeds
//!     a threshold (default 5 min). Avoids fighting NTP's normal sub-
//!     second drift correction.
//!   * RTC-friendly: if `/dev/rtc0` exists, also writes the corrected
//!     time to the RTC so it survives reboots.
//!   * One-shot per startup window: once we've corrected the clock,
//!     subsequent responses are within tolerance so we leave them be.
//!
//! Threading: `clock_settime` modifies CLOCK_REALTIME but does NOT
//! affect CLOCK_MONOTONIC, so any `Instant` values still measure
//! elapsed time correctly across the adjustment.
