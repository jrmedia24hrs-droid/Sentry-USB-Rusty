//! `sentryusb-tesla-telemetry` — BLE telemetry sampler daemon.
//!
//! Runs as a systemd service alongside `sentryusb.service`. Watches
//! the USB gadget LUN for clip writes (car-awake signal), takes
//! samples via `tesla-control`, and inserts them into the
//! `telemetry_samples` table.
//!
//! Design notes:
//!   * Sampling rate adapts to car state — 15 s while awake, 15 min
//!     while asleep (using the non-waking `body-controller-state`).
//!   * Holds the `/tmp/ble_radio_owner` lock while sampling so the
//!     keep-awake nudge and iOS GATT daemon serialize cleanly.
//!   * Stops `sentryusb-ble.service` (iOS GATT) while the lock is
//!     held, restarts it on release.
//!   * Re-reads `sentryusb.conf` on every loop iteration — toggling
//!     BLE off in settings stops sampling within ~15 s without a
//!     daemon restart.
