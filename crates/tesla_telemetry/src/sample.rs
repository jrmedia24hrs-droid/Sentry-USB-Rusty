//! Shells out to `tesla-control` and parses the JSON output into

//!
//! Two sample modes:
//!   * [`sample_state`]: combines `state climate` + `state charge` for
//!     the full payload (battery %, battery temp, interior + exterior
//!     temp, HVAC). Used while the car is awake.
//!   * [`sample_body_controller`]: `body-controller-state` only —
//!     doesn't wake a sleeping car. Returns sparse data (no temps /
//!     HVAC) but confirms the car is still reachable.
//!
//! JSON field-name matching is intentionally permissive: tesla-control

//! and accept the first match. If a field is missing entirely, the
