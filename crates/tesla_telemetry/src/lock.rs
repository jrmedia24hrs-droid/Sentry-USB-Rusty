//! BLE radio lock — a single file under `/tmp` that says who owns
//! `hci0` right now.
//!
//! Three potential users compete for the radio: this telemetry
//! sampler, the keep-awake nudge loop ([`run/awake_start`]), and the
//! iOS-app GATT daemon (`sentryusb-ble.service`). On a Pi's single
//! controller, two centrals can't reliably run simultaneously, and a
//! central + peripheral coexistence pattern works but is fiddly with
//! BlueZ. So we serialize: whoever holds the lock has exclusive
//! access; the daemon stops `sentryusb-ble` while held, restarts it
//! on release.
//!
//! The file lives at `/tmp/ble_radio_owner` and contains
//! `<owner-name>\n<unix_seconds>\n`. Both the bash keep-awake script
//! and this daemon read/write it. A stale lock (>24h old) is treated
//! as crashed and re-claimed.
